                <p> 
                    Iâ€™m a <strong>Creative Developer</strong> based in Greece, with an education in traditional Art and an affinity for programming 
                    and problem-solving which I combine with my diverse educational background (including full-stack development, game development, 3D and UX/UI Design) 
                    to create digital experiences, mainly websites and videogames.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal is to seamlessly blend aesthetics with functionality, making every interaction a visually captivating and intuitive experience that stands out and stays memorable. 
                    Drawing inspiration from the ever-evolving design landscape, I strive to stay ahead of the curve, setting as a standard that my creations not only meet but exceed contemporary expectations, reflecting my commitment to continuous growth and evolution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Driven by a thirst for new experiences and challenges, I thrive in pushing boundaries and exploring uncharted territories. I work best in
                    inclusive environments where my skills are recognized and valued and where I am trusted with freedom to 
                    explore and develop my ideas and initiatives.
                    For me every project is much more than a task; it's an opportunity to learn and innovate.
