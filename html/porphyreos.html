                A rendition of the <a class="pagelink" href="https://www.surfertoday.com/games/the-worlds-hardest-game" target="_blank">"World's Hardest Game"</a>. 
                The World's Hardest Game is hard...but it is also very ugly.
                My mission was to come up with a character, a setting, and a story. I also decided on an art style and a color palette.
                Porphyreos is a novice necromancer, one night he was having fun practicing his spells but he also
                had a little too much red wine. He accidentally summoned 4 dudes from the dead and now he doesn't
                know how to send them back. So, he wakes up in a dungeon and he has to sneak past them to escape.
