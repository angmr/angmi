                A guess the number game written in Python, typically a console game but in this case it has a basic UI made with Tkinter.
                I encourage you to download and try this game out yourself, it's free and very short. Anything else I say, will spoil the 
                experience as the element of surprise and expections play a big part in it.

                            I chose to add graphics to the classic "Guess the Number" game using Tkinter. I kept only the central idea that there is a 
                            hidden number, and the player tries to find it. I used this as an opportunity to create something different. 
                            I limited the hidden number between 0 and 10. This information is available to the player only if they want additional help
                            by clicking the "Get Hint" button. Otherwise, they only have guidance on whether to guess higher or lower, in the form of a
                            pop-up window that appears when the player clicks the "Submit" button, and only if their guess is different from the hidden number.<br>
                            <br>
                            I keep track of the player's attempts in the variable "attempts," which is initialized to 0 and increases each time the "Submit" 
                            button is pressed, provided that the user's input is valid. The program informs the player before starting the game that they have 
                            only three attempts to find the hidden number. However, nothing prevents them from continuing to try and press the "Submit" button 
                            even if they exceed the attempt limit.

                            In addition to the hidden number, there is an ASCII bunny living inside the program that "controls" it and makes an appearence to give tasty donuts to those 
                            who win. The bunny gets annoyed when the player uses the program in a non-predefined way, reacts by displaying messages, changing 
                            expressions, and then disabling the "Submit" button so that the user cannot press it.<br><br>
                            Finally, it displays an exit button, forcing the user to leave and leave it alone. In this way, the user and the program battle for control and power, and the purpose of the 
                            game shifts from finding the hidden number to simply interacting with the program.
                            When the player finds the hidden number, the bunny appears holding a donut, and the player can click on it to take it. 
                            Whether the player wins or loses, they can continue to press the "Submit" button until it is disabled. However, 
                            the bunny appears only if the player has won and gives them only one donut.
